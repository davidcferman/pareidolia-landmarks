## Pareidolia Landmarks Dataset

### Labels
The landmarks and bounding boxes are contained in landmarks.npy and bboxes.npy. These labels correspond to 150 pareidolia images and provide 9 landmarks and one bounding box per image.

### Images
The images can be downloaded from https://osf.io/9g4rz/. It appears that this link no longer provides all 150 images that were originally labeled. Therefore, we include a mapping.txt file which provides a mapping from the subset of images that remain available to their indices in our label files. We will be in contact with the contributors of the above link for permission to release the full image set corresponding to our released labels.
